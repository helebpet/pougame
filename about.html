        <p>
            This net art project is dedicated to one of my earliest internet memories. I received my first phone on my
            10th birthday. It was a Samsung smartphone, so my first interactions with the internet were related to
            games that I could download on my device. The first game I downloaded on my phone was <i>Pou</i>, as all of
            my classmates were also playing this game. In the game, I took care of a cute creature and played mini-games
            for which I earned coins and then bought new clothes, accessories, and equipment for my virtual pet.
